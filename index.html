                  Rapid advances are being made in blockchain technology, which is a foundational and platform technology considering its existing offerings and it is expected to be a key enabling technology and a new general purpose technology to revolutionize the business activities and interactions in the future considering its economic, political, humanitarian, and legal system benefits. Finance services (Fintech) have been one of the most active domains with increasingly bigger data, and faster innovations. Howerver, blockchain is still in its infancy and many research issues remain unsolved regarding blockchain itself and its applications. This may pose it to suffer various issues. The goal of this workshop is to promote community-wide discussion identifying the advanced applications, technologies and theories for blockchain. We seek submissions of papers that invent novel techniques, investigate new applications, introduce advanced methodologies on Fintech and blockchain systems.

                  <p>
                      All papers need to be submitted electronically through the 
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=1stisfbs"><b>EasyChair website</b></a>
                       with PDF format. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Papers must be clearly presented in English, must not exceed 6 pages in 
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html"><b>IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Format</b></a>
                      , including tables, figures, references and appendices. The limit length of accepted papers should be 8 pages at most. Papers will be selected based on their originality, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation assessed by at least three reviewers. All submitted papers will be judged through double-blind reviews, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work. IEEE Blockchain 2021 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference. All accepted papers will be published in IEEE CPS proceedings (EI Indexed) and collected by IEEE Xplore Digital Library.

                                  Carefully refer to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer incapable of grasping the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author. For example, instead of "In prior work [1], we presented a scheme that ...," sentences in the spirit of "In prior work, Clark et al. [1] presented a scheme that ..." should be used. With this method, the full citation of the referred paper can still be given, such as "[1] A. Clark ..., "Analysis of...", and it is not acceptable to say "[1] Reference deleted for double-blind review."

                                  The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arxiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists.
                              </li>

                                  The submitted manuscript (PDF file) should be text-searchable. Any submission that does not meet this requirement may be returned without review.

                                  Many of the editing tools automatically add metadata to the generated PDF file containing information that may violate the double blind policy. Please remove any possible metadata that can link your manuscript to you. This includes removing names, affiliation, license numbers etc. from the Metadata as well as from the paper. Failing to meet this requirement may also lead to a rejection without review.
